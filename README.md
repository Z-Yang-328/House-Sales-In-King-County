# House-Sale-In-King-County
  This project is mainly designed on SAS and partially on Python
  The SAS code may be confusing because of the repitation of certain blocks. But I will still put them here along with the report of my project.
  
  Actually this is mainly an data analysis field project rather than a machine learning one, so the most important part of this project may shown in the slides.
